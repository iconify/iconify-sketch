## What is Iconify?

Iconify is an open source platform for working with icons.

Originally it was designed to replace outdated icon fonts with modern SVG framework. Now it is a much bigger project. Iconify offers:

-   Plugins for design tools, such as this plug-in for Sketch.
-   [SVG framework](https://iconify.design/) to easily embed icons in HTML.
-   [React, Vue, Svelte and Ember icon components](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/components/) for developers that prefer to use framework native icon components instead of SVG framework.
-   [Icon picker](http://github.com/iconify/icon-finder), allowing developers to add icon search functionality to applications, such as website builders.

## Installation

Click ["Releases"](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-sketch/releases) link, download the latest file, unpack it, open `iconify.sketchplugin` in Finder. Finder should launch Sketch that should install this plug-in.

If plug-in installation fails, copy `iconify.sketchplugin` to `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/`.

## Usage
